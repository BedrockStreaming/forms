This utility package allows to add a visual validation feedback to your users.

## :question: Why ?

By default, you can already validate your forms without adding any other library to the mix. It is also very trivial to display some error message since it is exposed via props. So why would you need something like `form validation rule list` ? **To give your users some hints about what is going wrong with their typing**. It's too often that we apply several validations rules on a single input and many of those rules are complaining at the same time, then what to display ?

## :building_construction: Install
